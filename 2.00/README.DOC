To all users of GRAFIX 2.0:

The  TANDY11.COM program  that enables  640x200x16 color  graphics does not work
properly on  the Tandy 1000 SL/2  and TL/2 computers. When  the 640x200x16 color
graphics mode  is used, all other  graphic modes are distorted.  The only way to
get them to  work properly again is to  reboot the computer. Text modes  are not
affected. The  program works fine on  the Tandy 1000 SL  and TL computers. Until
the problem  is solved, do  not use the  TANDY11.COM program if  you own a Tandy
1000 SL/2 or TL/2. I will try to correct the situation as soon as possible.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,
Joseph A. Albrecht
